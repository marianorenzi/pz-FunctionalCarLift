description=Enabling the option to convert the vanilla tiles, you will be able to pick-up the world car lifts and place them on your own base. It requires a screwdriver and Electrical Level 3, and will result in four heavy parts. Be careful, it can break! Improve your chances with more Electrical level.

description=[h2]Frequently Asked Questions[/h2]
description=[strike][b]- Why a screwdriver and electrical skill for picking up?[/b][/strike]
description=- Well, how moveable system works is by using tiles created in TileZed. These tiles have properties, and in those properties you select the tool required to pick it up from a list, and that tool also carries the required skill (you cannot pick a wrench with carpentry skill). [strike]So, unfortunately the wrench has no skill associated, and I didn't want to make it easy to pick up. So screwdriver, which has electrical skill requirement attached, was the second best choice.[/strike] FOUND A WAY! Now you can pick-up and place the lift parts with a Wrench and Mechanics skill.

description=[b]- Why does my vehicle don't fit in the lift?[/b]
description=- Some vanilla car lift on small repair shops have only 2 squares without hitboxes, so the fit is TIGHT. Big repair shops' lifts are wider (3 squares without hitboxes), and you can build your own custom width car lift.
